# Contactless_Vital_Sign_Measure
This repo is for measuring the heart rate and respiration rate using the webcam. Working on SpO2 oxygen level and will try for blood pressure, body temperature too.

# Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Running with Python 3.8

# Implementation
```
python app.py
```
<!--- - In case of plotting graphs, run "graph_plot.py" - For the Eulerian Video Magnification implementation, run "amplify_color.py" --->
  -If want to run individually on GUI, 
      run "main.py" for Heart Rate, "main-r.py" for Respiration Rate and "main-s.py" for SpO2 Oxygen level.
